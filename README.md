program that lets a user move a turtle two ways.
1. click a location with a mouse, the turtle will travel there over time. clicking somewhere else will cause turtle to ignore previous path.
2. using arrow keys
*trying a mixture of both will give various results because neither have priority.
*Have all 6 files (including turtle.png) in the same location, then run build.bat.
